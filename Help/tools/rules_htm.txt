# HTML Cleanup Rules.txt
#
# syntax:  Every non-empty line of this file that does not begin with a hash symbol (#)
# will be interpreted as a rule.  Each rule must conform to the following syntax:
#     find_regex~~replace_string[~~options]
# find_regex is a regular expression (potentially including groups) in .NET syntax.
#     The Regex cannot include two sequential tildes (~~). Hope that's not too
#     inconvenient.
# replace_string is a replacement string, including group placeholders. Again no
#     double-tildes allowed.
# options (optional) is one or more regular expression options.  Currently the only
#     supported options is "i", which means case-insensitive.

# remove unwanted title on right-hand side of every page
